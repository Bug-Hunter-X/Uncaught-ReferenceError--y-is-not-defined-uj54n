# Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined
This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in JavaScript within HTML contexts: the `Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined` error.  This error arises when a variable is used before it has been declared or assigned a value. The example showcases this issue and provides a solution.

## Bug
The `bug.html` file contains a simple HTML structure with embedded JavaScript. The JavaScript attempts to perform a calculation involving a variable `y` that hasn't been defined, leading to the `ReferenceError`.

## Solution
